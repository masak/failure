In here are the files I always end up copying to a new directory when
starting to fiddle with a new presentation. I'd hate for them to be lost,
so here they are on github, my extended hard drive.

Also, I keep wanting to generalize/improve this software to something general,
sort of a presentation framework, something that others could get some
mileage out of. That hasn't happened, and it keeps on not happening. Thus,
the name 'failure' seems fitting for this repository.

Consider what's in here to be licensed under Artistic 2.0 for the time being.
